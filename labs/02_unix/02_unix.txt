# Step 2: - Use the diff command
Which "fruits" have been added to or removed from fruitsOld.txt to get to fruitsNew.txt?
Cranberry was removed from the oldFruits.txt file 
Jackfruit was added to fruitsNew.txt
Nectarine and Prickly Pear weres removed from fruitsOld.txt


# Step 3: - Use the wc command
Find the # of lines in the testPasswd.txt file.
wc -l testPasswd.txt

Find the # of characters in the testPasswd.txt
wc -m testPasswd.txt


# Step 4: - Use the cut command
Print a list of the usernames from the testPasswd.txt files (print the first columns only)
cut -f 1 -d ':' testPasswd.tx

Print out only the LN column and HW1 grade column from the grades.txt file.
cut -f 2 -f 4 -d ' ' grades.txt


# Step 5: - Practice using pipes
Use cut, sort, and uniq to print the groups that users are in within the testPasswd.testPasswd.txt file. (Each group is a #. When printing each group should get a line and there should be no duplicates printed)
cut -f 4 -d ':' testPasswd.txt | sort -n | uniq

Pipe the output of the above into a file in your home directory
cut -f 4 -d ':' testPasswd.txt | sort -n | uniq > ~/output.txt

Use grep and cut to filter the testPasswd.txt file to only display usernames that start with 'm' 'w' or 's' and their home directories (sixth column)
cut -f 1,6 -d ':' testPasswd.txt | grep '^[mws]'

# Step 6: - Use the sed command
Using sed and regular expressions try playin garound with the leetSpeak.txt file.
 	-Remove all the letters
		sed 's/[a-z]//g' leetSpeak.txt
	-Remove all the numbers
		sed 's/[0-9]//g' leetSpeak.txt
	-Replace all the numbers with an '_'
		sed 's/[0-9]/_/g' leetSpeak.txt
Create a script that pipees together multiple sed commands to replace each number with its matching character. (This can be done without piping, how? For this problem please use pipes)
