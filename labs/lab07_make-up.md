Last week I missed my lab to attend GitHub's [Universe Conference](https://githubuniverse.com) as a GitHub Campus Rep. It was an incredible opportunity, and I learned a great deal from meeting a lot of smart friendly people. Professor Paradise asked me to submit a write-up reflecting on my experience in peer code review to earn my points for the lab.

## Peer Code Review at HackCU
My most recent experience with peer code reveiw is my ongoing work with the HackCU admin team, specifically our web team. Our main focus over the last few months has been developing the websites for our Startups2Students internship networking event, and the landing page for our Local Hack Day hackathon in December.
